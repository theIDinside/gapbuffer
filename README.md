# Gapbuffer for use with cxgledit
Beginning of some text buffer type to switch out the current hack-n-slash I have right now with std::string

Folder ./gb contains sources for the gapbuffer, ./unittest contains a hacked together unit testing class
which is used for more easily display some rudimentary tests and print it nicely with fmtlib.
